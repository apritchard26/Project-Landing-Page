                <h1>I love my cats</h1>
                <p>Here is a paragraph dedicated to my two awesome cats. Bok, the second child, was "gifted" to me in Summer 2023. We took him in as just a little 4 week old and he is the cutest. And my lovely Dusty, rest in peace. He was so old and frail when he decided to join our family. It is weird to think about, a cat, over a decade old, alive since I was probably around 7 or younger, just showed up and became so important to me at 18 years old.</p>
